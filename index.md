## Introduction

Throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University, not only did I learn the fundamental and advanced concepts of computer science, I have also learned a lot about myself. The following ePortfolio is a glimpse of my strengths and skills gained over the past two years. Prior to enrollment, my career goal was to graduate and start a career as a software engineer. After studying and understanding the facets of computer science and the breadth to which it extends, my goals have shifted to starting a career as a data analyst. 

### Working as a student at SNHU

A large part of my time at SNHU involved working with others collaboratively. This was accomplished through discussion, debate, and working on software projects. Many of our projects involved write ups where we must communicate our thought process, decision making, and reasoning. Some projects involved us to explain our projects to a non-technical audience. Projects like this provided the students an invaluable opportunity to prepare communicating with project stakeholders. Data base languages such as SQL and MongoDB were used throughout our program given students the opportunity to work with both structured and unstructured languages. 

### Artifacts 

The provided calculator project exemplifies my ability to design and enhance software projects. Initially, the calculator was built with a team of other collaborators using Bitbucket. Once the project was completed, we were left with a functioning calculator. The enhancements I provided demonstrate that while I can successfully collaborate with others on a team, I can also independently enhance software features. 

Working with data structures and algorithms is a key part of being a student of computer science. Provided in the artifacts is a circular doubly linked list that allows users to add songs to a playlist. Originally, the playlist was only an array list. After I enhanced the project, it became a circular doubly linked list where the songs are connected allowing the user to move forward, backward, and from the end to the front and vice versa in the playlist. Enhancing an array list in this fashion provides evidence that I can work comfortably with data structures. 

During our course work we were exposed to different types of data bases. Two of the more deeply studied are SQL and MongoDB. The artifact provided is a sample of a SQL script. The SQL script performs basic SQL commands but also uses some advanced features of SQL. For example, on top of creating and editing basic tables, indexes are created which significantly enhance the query function of databases. This artifact provides evidence that I am comfortable in working with SQL as a database to perform basic and advanced functions. 


### Code Review

The following is an informal code review of several projects. The code is analyzed for syntax, format, functionality, and security. Ways to enhance the project are also discussed.

### Software Engineering Example

The following is an example of a project that exhibits my skills to work as a software engineer. The project was developed collaboratively with others. Enhancements to the calculator were made idependently.

### Data Structure Example

The following artifact is a circular doubly linked playlist. The project orginally was an array list. The array list was enhanced to a circular doubly linked playlist to showcase my capability of working with more complex data structures.

### Data Base Example

The following is a SQL script designed to showcase the usage of several features in SQL. SQL basics such as creating, editing, and inserting information into a table is provided. Advanced features such as index creation is also used to enhance the query abilities of the database.
